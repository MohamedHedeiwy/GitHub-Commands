git reset --- unadd
git reset HEAD~1 --- To go back one commit

To go back to a certain commit follow the following
#1 git log
#2 get the hash of the commit you want to reset too
#3 git reset (hash)
This will unstage anything that happened after that hash, but it wont remove it from you screen


To permanently go back in time 
git reset --hard (hash)
this will completly remove the changes instead of unstaging them only
